Welcome again!

I am a student trying to use coding to perform data analysis on datasets using the the knowledge I have learnt in my lessons so far. Stay tuned to see what I will be doing...

### Shiny Web App

# Dataset

For my analysis, I will be looking at a dataset about cars that was found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayushparwal2026/cars-dataset.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
cars <- read.csv("used_cars_data.csv")
glimpse(cars)
```
