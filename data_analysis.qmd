Here is a summary of all the variables in the dataset.
```{r, echo = F, warning = F, message = F}
library(tidyverse)
new_cars <- read.csv("used_cars_data.csv")
cars1 <- new_cars %>%
  separate(Mileage, into = c("Mileage_v", "Mileage_unit"), sep = " ")

cars2 <- cars1 %>%
  separate(Name, into = c("Brand", "Model"), sep = " ", extra = "merge") %>%
  mutate(Brand = case_when(
    Brand == "ISUZU" ~ "Isuzu",
    Brand == "Land" ~ "Land Rover",
    TRUE ~ Brand
  ))

cars <- cars2 %>%
  mutate("Engine/CC" = as.numeric(str_remove(Engine, "CC")),
         "Power/bhp" = as.numeric(str_remove(Power, "bhp")),
         "Mileage_value" = as.numeric(Mileage_v), 
         "Car_age" =  year(Sys.Date()) - Year
  ) %>%
  select(-c(Power, Engine, Mileage_v)) 

cars <- cars %>%
  select(Brand, Model, Location, Year, Car_age, Kilometers_Driven, Fuel_Type, Transmission, Owner_Type, Mileage_value, Mileage_unit, `Engine/CC`, `Power/bhp`, Seats, New_Price, Price)
knitr::kable(head(summary(cars)))
```
Let's get started!

# 1. Lemon market: How are the prices of second-hand cars in India like?

```{r, echo = F, warning = F, message = F}
cars %>%
  filter(Owner_Type == c("First", "Second")) %>%
  mutate(Year = ym(str_c(Year, "-01"))) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  group_by(Year, Owner_Type) %>%
  summarise(Price = mean(Price, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Price)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(colour = "red") +
  facet_wrap(~ Owner_Type) +
  labs(title = "Overall prices of first and second hand cars in India against time") +
  theme_bw() 
```
<div style="text-align: justify;">
There has been an increase in second-hand car prices till around 2013 (though this may vary, eg. Bangladore and Delhi experienced increases earlier) but seems to be mostly coming down after that, leading to a growing difference in prices of first and second hand cars. If we were to do some predictions (predictive pricing models will not be covered here), the decreasing trend can provide a benchmark against which sellers' asking prices can be compared. If sellers consistently ask for prices significantly higher than the predicted values for similar cars, it may indicate that they are attempting to exploit buyers' lack of information or conceal defects in the vehicles. Thus knowing price trends can better protect consumers in the lemon market as it allows them to assess the risk associated with purchasing a used car through price signals.

However, if the growing difference in prices is driven by increased uncertainty and risk associated with buying used cars, it may signal a market failure that requires intervention to improve transparency and consumer protection. This widening price gap could result from a worsening lemon market problem, where buyers become increasingly wary of purchasing used cars due to concerns about hidden defects or poor quality. Therefore, there is also a need to investigate the cause of this growing price difference.
</div>

Now let's see how these pricing trends may differ in different parts in India.
<br>
```{r, echo = F, warning = F, message = F}
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
cars %>%
  filter(Owner_Type == "Second") %>%
  mutate(Year = ym(str_c(Year, "-01"))) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  group_by(Location, Year) %>%
  summarise(Price = mean(Price, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Price)) +
  geom_line(colour = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Prices of second hand cars in different parts of India against time") +
  facet_wrap(~ Location, nrow = 4, scales = "free_y") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, size = 7, vjust = 0.5),
        plot.title = element_text(family = "Helvetica"))
```
<div style="text-align: justify;">
In Chennai, Delhi, and Jaipur, it's notable that price trends are still on the rise. Consumers in these areas should recognize that comparing prices of second-hand cars with those in other parts of India may not be valid. Additionally, they shouldn't be surprised if sellers continue to offer such (second-hand) models at even higher prices.
</div>
# 2. Carbon emissions? (Using average kilometers driven in India)

For this graph, one outlier from Chennai was removed.
```{r, echo = F, warning = F, message = F}
cars %>%
  filter(Kilometers_Driven <= 4e+06) %>%
  mutate(Year = ym(str_c(Year, "-01"))) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  group_by(Year, Location) %>%
  summarise(Ave_km_driven = mean(Kilometers_Driven, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Ave_km_driven)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Graph of average kilometers driven in each part of India against time",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Average kilometers driven") +
  theme_bw()
```
<div style="text-align: justify;">
There is a decrease in average kilometres driven over time and generally, since less distance is covered, there should be less gas emissions (though it still depends on a variety of factors). So are cars a large contributor of carbon emissions into the air?
```{r, out.height= "700px",out.width= "800px",echo=F,eval=TRUE,fig.cap="Photo from *Our World in Data* on India's Carbon Emissions"}
knitr::include_graphics("india_emissions.png")
```
If we were to assume ave_km_driven â‰ˆ carbon emissions, this means that cars are becoming smaller contributors to the increase in global emissions as shown in the image since they display opposite trends. Moreover, it does not seem that CO2 emissions from cars will double by 2050 which means the policies in place, and the measure implemented by the government seem to be working.

Next, here's a <b>shiny app</b> to investigate this phenomenon more closely in different cities of India. You can user your cursor to hover over the line graph or bar graph to view the specific values of average kilometers driven!
</div> 

```{=html}
<iframe height="400" width="100%" frameborder="no" src="https://cc01lz-yasmineong.shinyapps.io/MyShinyApp/"> </iframe>
```
<br> <div style="text-align: justify;">
If you click through, you can see that there is all cities show a decrease in average kilometers driven throughout the years. But upon closer inspection, different cars brands contribute differently to the average distance travelled. Depending on the fuel efficiency of the brand, more can then be derived about the true emission level generated by each one of them, which can aid the government in deciding which firms to clamp down on for emission levels.

# 3. Preferences and car usage in India

Now, let's zoom into car brands:
```{r, echo = F}
library(patchwork)
market_share <- cars %>%
  group_by(Brand) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(market_share = count / sum(count) * 100) %>%
  arrange(desc(market_share)) %>%
  head(10)
pie(market_share$market_share, 
    labels = paste(market_share$Brand, ": ", round(market_share$market_share, 2), "%"), 
    main = "Market Share Analysis by Car Brand (Top 10)",
    col = c("#004BF8", "#0080F8", "#00A9F8", "#02CEF7", "#02E8F7", "#A3F7FF", "#A3AEFF", "#C489FF", "#B603FF", "#6C03BE"),
    font = 3,
    cex = 0.8)
```
<div style="text-align: justify;"> Maruti seems to be the most popular car brand that Indian consumers go for, seeing how it has the highest count of cars owned by Indians in all the regions (in the dataset). What if we take a closer look into why this may be so by looking at price:
</div>
```{r, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
cars_summary <- cars %>%
  group_by(Brand) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(Count))

top_10_brands <- cars_summary %>%
  head(10) %>%
  pull(Brand)

cars$Top_10 <- ifelse(cars$Brand %in% top_10_brands, "Top 10", "Others")

ggplot(cars, aes(x = Price, y = Brand)) +
  geom_boxplot(colour = "#00A6FF") +
  facet_wrap(~ Top_10, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "Price Ranges for Each Car Brand", 
       x = "Price", 
       y = "Brand",
      ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) 
```
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Upon closer examination of the prices of individual car brands, a preference for the most economical option, Maruti, is evident among the top 10. Meanwhile, brands such as Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz, which command higher average prices, consequently hold a smaller market share as fewer consumers opt for them. However, their inclusion in the top 10 may suggest a significant demand among Indian consumers for luxury car brands. This is also reflected in the rest of the caar brands: Porches have one of the highest average prices but do not have the smallest number of consumers.

Next, what about do the numerical variables of this dataset tell us?

<div style="text-align: justify;">
1. Preferences for low costs, 5-seater vehicles, lower power and engine vehicles.
2. The distance travelled by cars in India are relatively short, which could be because of traffic conditions and high congestion so consumers limit their usage for cars for work only, for example.
3. Most of the histograms are highly skewed, which may lead to some poor performances of certain models.
</div>
# 4. Predictors in the market

```{r, echo = F}
library(ggcorrplot)
numerical_variables <- cars %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  select(Price, Car_age, Kilometers_Driven, Mileage_value, `Engine/CC`, `Power/bhp`, Seats) 

ggcorrplot(cor(numerical_variables),
           hc.order = TRUE,  
           lab = TRUE,
           lab_size = 2,
           outline.color = "black",  
           colors = c("blue", "white", "red"),  
           title = "Correlation Heatmap of Numerical variables")

```
<div style="text-align: justify;">
1. Strongest correlation between the *power and engine capacity* of a car. So if Indian consumers have no need for power in a car, it is likely that the engine capacity will not be high as well. This can serve as an indicator to car makers to conserve their resources and follow the trend.

2. There is a strong correlation between *costs and power* of the car: the higher the BHP, the higher the costs of the car which matches what vehicle analytics say. However, since customers in India tend to go for lower prices, producers need not create so many high-powered cars. Moreover, India's cities are known for their traffic congestion thus smaller, less powerful engines are practical for navigating these conditions more efficiently. Additionally, consumers who see this can predict that a high price would mean a high-powered car. If they have no need for this, lower-priced cars would be a go-to option.

3. Relationship of *price and engine* of a car is also moderately strong. This seems to be in line with India's taxation policies: they impose higher taxes on cars with larger engines and as a result higher BHP, making such vehicles much more unaffordable. Again, both consumers and producers can make use of this to see what are some characteristics that come with pricing of a car, as well as how to price a car for the factors above.

The small values and faint shades indicate that the rest of the variables do not have much of a correlation and price is not indicative of those characteristics.

If we take a look back at the numerical variable graphs presented and zoom in a little, we can see some characteristics associated with the different car transmission as well.

```
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Automatic cars seem to have higher power and engine than manual cars which do not align with India's consumer needs. More may opt for manual cars since they are of lower power and engine thus auto-car makers can either produce more manual cars (since there seems to be more demand for this), or save costs by lowering the power of automatic cars.
