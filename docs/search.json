Lemon market: How are the prices of second-hand cars in India like?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere has been an increase in second-hand car prices till around 2013 (though this may vary, eg. Bangladore and Delhi experienced increases earlier) but seems to be mostly coming down after that, leading to a growing difference in prices of first and second hand cars. If we were to do some predictions (predictive pricing models will not be covered here), the decreasing trend can provide a benchmark against which sellers’ asking prices can be compared. If sellers consistently ask for prices significantly higher than the predicted values for similar cars, it may indicate that they are attempting to exploit buyers’ lack of information or conceal defects in the vehicles. Thus knowing price trends can better protect consumers in the lemon market as it allows them to assess the risk associated with purchasing a used car through price signals.\nHowever, if the growing difference in prices is driven by increased uncertainty and risk associated with buying used cars, it may signal a market failure that requires intervention to improve transparency and consumer protection. This widening price gap could result from a worsening lemon market problem, where buyers become increasingly wary of purchasing used cars due to concerns about hidden defects or poor quality. Therefore, there is also a need to investigate the cause of this growing price difference.\n\nNow let’s see how these pricing trends may differ in different parts in India. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Chennai, Delhi, and Jaipur, it’s notable that price trends are still on the rise. Consumers in these areas should recognize that comparing prices of second-hand cars with those in other parts of India may not be valid. Additionally, they shouldn’t be surprised if sellers continue to offer such (second-hand) models at even higher prices.\n\n\n\n2. Carbon emissions? Average kilometers driven in India\nFor this graph, one outlier from Chennai was removed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a decrease in average kilometres driven over time and generally, since less distance is covered, there should be less gas emissions (though it still depends on a variety of factors).\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto from Our World in Data on India’s Carbon Emissions\n\n\n\n\nIf we were to assume ave_km_driven ≈ carbon emissions, this means that cars are becoming smaller contributors to the increase in global emissions as shown in the image since they display opposite trends. Moreover, it does not seem that CO2 emissions from cars will double by 2050 which means the policies in place, and the measure implemented by the government seem to be working.\nNext, here’s a shiny app to investigate this phenomenon more closely in different cities of India.\n\n\n \n\nIf you click through, you can see that there is all cities show a decrease in average kilometers driven throughout the years. But upon closer inspection, different cars brands contribute differently to the average distance travelled. Depending on the fuel efficiency on the brand, more can then be derived about the true emission level generated by each one of them, which can aid the government in deciding which firms to clamp down on for emission levels.\n\n\n\n3. Preferences and car usage in India\n Here’s bar graphs of the categorical variables of this dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n Now, let’s zoom into car brands:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaruti seems to be the most popular car brand that Indian consumers go for, seeing how it has the highest count of cars owned by Indians in all the regions (in the dataset). Let’s take a closer look into why this may be so by looking at price:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon closer examination of the prices of individual car brands, a preference for the most economical option, Maruti, is evident among the top 10. Meanwhile, brands such as Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz, which command higher average prices, consequently hold a smaller market share as fewer consumers opt for them. However, their inclusion in the top 10 may suggest a significant demand among Indian consumers for luxury car brands.\nNext, what about do the numerical variables of this dataset tell us?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreferences for low costs, 5-seater vehicles, lower power and engine vehicles.\nAutomatic cars seem to have higher power and engine than manual cars –&gt; More may opt for manual cars since they are of lower power and engine.\nCars in India do not travel very long distances.\nMost of the histograms are highly skewed, which may lead to some poor performances of certain models.\n\n\n\n4. Predictors in the market\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrongest correlation between the power and engine capacity of a car.\nThere is a strong correlation between costs and power of the car –&gt; the higher the BHP, the higher the costs of the car which matches what vehicle analytics say. However, since customers in India tend to go for lower prices, producers need not create so many high-powered cars. Moreover, India’s cities are known for their traffic congestion thus smaller, less powerful engines are practical for navigating these conditions efficient.\nRelationship of price and engine of a car is also moderately strong. This seems to be in line with India’s taxation policies: they impose higher taxes on cars with larger engines and as a result higher BHP, making such vehicles much more unafforable.\n\nCitations:  https://www.cars24.com/blog/what-is-bhp-in-cars/  Ritchie, H., Roser, M., & Rosado, P.

    "text": "Background Information\n\n\nLemon Market\n\nThe lemon market in India is a huge problem due to information asymmetry between buyers and sellers. This asymmetry means that buyers are unable to access sufficient vehicle information, enabling sellers to exploit uninformed buyers by selling lower-quality cars. In summary, market failure (distortions in true value of the product) caused by adverse selection and moral hazard is a significant problem for many innocent buyers in India where cost is a very influential factor in decision-making (Chen et al., 2022). By predicting car prices, we can reduce the information symmetry, facilitate informed decision-making and mitigate market failures.\n\nGlobal Warming: Carbon Emissions\n\nIndia is rapidly emerging as one of the world’s fastest-growing economies and is poised to become the most populous country globally. While the expansion and enhancement of road transport networks typically drive socio-economic progress, it has also led to a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions and the release of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOX) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) (IEA, n.d.).\nCurrently, road transport contributes to 12% of India’s energy-related CO2 emissions and significantly exacerbates urban air pollution (IEA, n.d.). With the nation striving to accommodate the growing demand for private transportation and freight movement, energy consumption and CO2 emissions from road transport are projected to potentially double by the year 2050 (IEA, n.d.).\nLet’s see if cars play such a huge role in contributing to global emissions in India, and whether or not emission levels have increased that drastically.\n\nPreferences\n\nWhen considering purchasing a new car, Indian consumers prioritise mileage over engine power. A significant majority of 60% prefer fuel-efficient vehicles (Gupta, 2016) which can be associated with the mileage of a car. Why is this so? Vehicles with good fuel efficiency often accumulate higher mileage before needing refueling, thus providing more value in terms of distance covered per gallon or litre of fuel.\nMoreover, numerous major cities in this area are home to populations exceeding 100 million, leading to congestion issues. Residents are recognizing that high-powered vehicles are impractical for urban driving in this region, prompting a shift towards prioritizing fuel efficiency (Gupta, 2016).\nOther preferences include cutting costs (72% of buyers aim to save money). The fluctuating fuel prices are a major concern, with 60% anticipating instability in the next year from August 2023 onwards (Gupta, 2016). Due to the expectation of continued high fuel prices, consumers opt for fuel-efficient cars to mitigate fuel expenses.\nDo consumers in our dataset reflect the same desires?\n\nPredictors\n\nUnderstanding how different car properties relate to each other can provide insights into market trends and consumer preferences through market analysis. Furthermore, it can be very helpful in decision-making as buyers can use predictions to estimate the value of a car based on its features, while sellers can set competitive prices based on market trends. Lastly, manufacturers can use predictive models to guide product development efforts. By understanding how changes in car properties affect consumer preferences and market demand, they can design vehicles that better meet customer needs in the form of product development.\n\nCitations:  1.
