Whether you're a fellow data enthusiast, a curious learner about what we do for exploratory data analysis, or someone interested in gaining insights from data, you're in the right place.\n\nIn this course, NM2207, the skills we have picked up are abundant and we are now tasked to examine the stories that data can tell us. That's why I created this space to share my exploratory data analysis journey with you!\n\nThrough the power of exploratory data analysis (EDA), we'll dive deep into a particular dataset about used cars in India, uncovering hidden patterns, trends, and relationships. From interactive visualizations to data-driven narratives, I'll be sharing insights derived from my analyses.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data.png){width=800px height=600px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI invite you to immerse yourself in the world of data analysis and storytelling. Take a moment to interact with the visualisations, explore the data yourself, and let the insights guide you on an enlightening journey.\n\nOnce again, thank you for joining me on this adventure. What are you waiting for? Let's dive in and uncover the stories hidden within the data together! \n\nCheck out the \"About\" page ----->\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncat(\"Coding is fun!\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nCoding is fun!\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
