    "text": "For my analysis, I will be looking at a dataset about cars that was found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayushparwal2026/cars-dataset.\nTitle: Cars Dataset\nDescription: The Cars Dataset contains information about various car models, including their specifications and pricing details in certain parts of India. It a collection of attributes related to different car models, possibly intended for analysis, modeling, or machine learning tasks related to the automotive industry.\nAttributes:\n\n\n.  Brand & Model\n . Location: Certain cities in India\n . Year\n . Kilometers driven\n . Fuel type\n . Transmission type\n . Owner type\n . Mileage: How many kilometers the vehicle can travel per litre of fuel\n . Engine: Measured in cubic capacity (CC). It refers to the amount of air and fuel that can be pushed through the cylinders in the engine. In most cases, the bigger the capacity, the more powerful the vehicle.\n . Power: Measured in brake horsepower (BHP). It refers to the horsepower of the car after accounting for the frictional losses in power from the engine. Generally, a higher BHP means increased speed, strength, and overall capabilities on the road. \n . Number of seats\n . Price: 1 Lakh = 100,000\n\n\nPotential Use Cases: This dataset could be used for various analytical purposes, including:\n\n\n.  Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and patterns in the automotive market.\n . Predictive modeling to estimate car prices based on their specifications.\n . Classification tasks to predict car types or fuel efficiency based on attributes.\n . Market research to understand consumer preferences and buying behavior in the automotive industry.\n . Academic research in fields like transportation engineering, automotive engineering, data science, and machine learning.\n . Product development\n .

Lemon market: How high are the prices of second-hand cars in India?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere has been an increase in second-hand car prices till 2017 (though this may vary, eg. Bangladore and Delhi experienced increases earlier) but seems to be mostly coming down after that. Perhaps the problem of the lemon market is slowly being alleviated as the difference in first and second hand car prices are increasing.\n\n\n2. Carbon emissions?

Preferences and car usage in India\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaruti seems to be the most popular car brand that Indian consumers go for. Upon further inspection into the prices of the individual car brands, we seem to see a preference for the lowest costing car (Maruti) among the top 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreferences for low costs, 5-seater vehicles, lower power and engine vehicles.\nAutomatic cars seem to have higher power and engine than manual cars –&gt; More may opt for manual cars since they are of lower power and engine.\nCars in India do not travel very long distances.\nMost of the histograms are highly skewed, which may lead to some poor performances of certain models.\n\n\n\n4. Predictors in the market\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrongest correlation between the power and engine capacity of a car.\nThere is a strong correlation between costs and power of the car –&gt; the higher the BHP, the higher the costs of the car which matches what vehicle analytics say. However, since customers in India tend to go for lower prices, producers need not create so many high-powered cars. Moreover, India’s cities are known for their traffic congestion thus smaller, less powerful engines are practical for navigating these conditions efficient.\nRelationship of price and engine of a car is also moderately strong. This seems to be in line with India’s taxation policies: they impose higher taxes on cars with larger engines and as a result higher BHP, making such vehicles much more unafforable.\n\nLink for reference: https://www.cars24.com/blog/what-is-bhp-in-cars/"

    "text": "Background into India’s car market\nWhen it comes to buying a new car, Indian consumers will root more for mileage than engine power. 60% of buyers want a fuel-efficient car (can be seen through high mileage) and 72% are looking to save money. Indian customers are seriously worried about fluctuating fuel prices and a good 60% don’t expect fuel price stability in the next 12 months (from August 2023). They believe that fuel prices will remain too high hence the choice for a fuel-efficient car to save fuel costs.\nAlso many of the bigger cities in this region boast 100 million plus population so congestion is a problem. People are realising that power packed vehicles cannot be driven in the cities in this region hence the focus on fuel efficiency.\nThe lemon market in India is a huge problem due to information asymmetry between buyers and sellers. This asymmetry means that buyers are unable to access sufficient vehicle information, enabling sellers to exploit uninformed buyers by selling lower-quality cars. In summary, market failure (distortions in true value of the product) caused by adverse selection and moral hazard is a significant problem for many innocent buyers in India where cost is an influential factor in decision-making.\nLinks for reference: https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/what-indian-consumers-prefer-the-most-while-buying-a-car/53825945  https://www.atlantis-press.com/article/125971556.pdf"

Whether you’re a fellow data enthusiast, a curious learner about what we do for exploratory data analysis, or someone interested in gaining insights from data, you’re in the right place.\nIn this course, NM2207, the skills we have picked up are abundant and we are now tasked to examine the stories that data can tell us. That’s why I created this space to share my exploratory data analysis journey with you!\nThrough the power of exploratory data analysis (EDA), we’ll dive deep into a particular dataset about used cars in India, uncovering hidden patterns, trends, and relationships. From interactive visualizations to data-driven narratives, I’ll be sharing insights derived from my analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\nI invite you to immerse yourself in the world of data analysis and storytelling. Take a moment to interact with the visualisations, explore the data yourself, and let the insights guide you on an enlightening journey.\nOnce again, thank you for joining me on this adventure. What are you waiting for? Let’s dive in and uncover the stories hidden within the data together!\n\ncat(\"Coding is fun!\")\n\nCoding is fun!"
