Lemon market: How high are the prices of second-hand cars in India?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n<br>\n\nThere has been an increase in second-hand car prices till 2017 (though this may vary, eg. Bangladore and Delhi experienced increases earlier) but seems to be mostly coming down after that. Perhaps the problem of the lemon market is slowly being alleviated as the difference in first and second hand car prices are increasing.\n\n# 2. Carbon emissions?

Upon further inspection into the prices of the individual car brands, we seem to see a preference for the lowest costing car (Maruti) among the top 10.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n1. Preferences for low costs, 5-seater vehicles, lower power and engine vehicles.\n2. Automatic cars seem to have higher power and engine than manual cars --> More may opt for manual cars since they are of lower power and engine.\n3. Cars in India do not travel very long distances.\n4. Most of the histograms are highly skewed, which may lead to some poor performances of certain models.\n\n# 4. Predictors in the market\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n1. Strongest correlation between the power and engine capacity of a car.\n\n2. There is a strong correlation between costs and power of the car --> the higher the BHP, the higher the costs of the car which matches what vehicle analytics say. However, since customers in India tend to go for lower prices, producers need not create so many high-powered cars. Moreover, India's cities are known for their traffic congestion thus smaller, less powerful engines are practical for navigating these conditions efficient.\n\n3. Relationship of price and engine of a car is also moderately strong. This seems to be in line with India's taxation policies: they impose higher taxes on cars with larger engines and as a result higher BHP, making such vehicles much more unafforable.\n\nLink for reference: https://www.cars24.com/blog/what-is-bhp-in-cars/",
