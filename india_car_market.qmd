### Background Information

<div style="text-align: justify;">
1. <span style="color:#00A6FF">Lemon Market</span>

The lemon market in India is a huge problem due to information asymmetry between buyers and sellers. This asymmetry means that buyers are unable to access sufficient vehicle information, enabling sellers to exploit uninformed buyers by selling lower-quality cars. In summary, market failure (distortions in true value of the product) caused by adverse selection and moral hazard is a significant problem for many innocent buyers in India where cost is a very influential factor in decision-making (Chen et al., 2022). By predicting car prices, we can reduce the information symmetry, facilitate informed decision-making and mitigate market failures.

2. <span style="color:#00A6FF">Global Warming: Carbon Emissions</span>

India is rapidly emerging as one of the world's fastest-growing economies and is poised to become the most populous country globally. While the expansion and enhancement of road transport networks typically drive socio-economic progress, it has also led to a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions and the release of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOX) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) (IEA, n.d.).

Currently, road transport contributes to 12% of India's energy-related CO2 emissions and significantly exacerbates urban air pollution (IEA, n.d.). With the nation striving to accommodate the growing demand for private transportation and freight movement, energy consumption and CO2 emissions from road transport are projected to potentially double by the year 2050 (IEA, n.d.).

Let's see if cars play such a huge role in contributing to global emissions in India, and whether or not emission levels have increased that drastically.

3. <span style="color:#00A6FF">Preferences</span>

When considering purchasing a new car, Indian consumers prioritise mileage over engine power. A significant majority of 60% prefer fuel-efficient vehicles (Gupta, 2016) which can be associated with the mileage of a car. Why is this so? Vehicles with good fuel efficiency often accumulate higher mileage before needing refueling, thus providing more value in terms of distance covered per gallon or litre of fuel. 

Moreover, numerous major cities in this area are home to populations exceeding 100 million, leading to congestion issues. Residents are recognizing that high-powered vehicles are impractical for urban driving in this region, prompting a shift towards prioritizing fuel efficiency (Gupta, 2016).

Other preferences include cutting costs (72% of buyers aim to save money). The fluctuating fuel prices are a major concern, with 60% anticipating instability in the next year from August 2023 onwards (Gupta, 2016). Due to the expectation of continued high fuel prices, consumers opt for fuel-efficient cars to mitigate fuel expenses.

Do consumers in our dataset reflect the same desires?

4. <span style="color:#00A6FF">Predictors</span>

Understanding how different car properties relate to each other can provide insights into market trends and consumer preferences through market analysis. Furthermore, it can be very helpful in decision-making as buyers can use predictions to estimate the value of a car based on its features, while sellers can set competitive prices based on market trends. Lastly, manufacturers can use predictive models to guide product development efforts. By understanding how changes in car properties affect consumer preferences and market demand, they can design vehicles that better meet customer needs in the form of product development.
